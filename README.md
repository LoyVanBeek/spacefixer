spacefixer
==========

I make lots of typos where I place the space sincorrect. This project tries to fix this by shuffling the spaces around and then using some probabilistic model to determine which shuffling is most likely to be correct. 

This is mostly intended as a learning experience, so I won't be using much libraries. I think.
